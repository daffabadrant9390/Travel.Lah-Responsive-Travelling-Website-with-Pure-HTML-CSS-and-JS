# Travel.Lah-Responsive-Travelling-Website-with-Pure-HTML-CSS-and-JS

This travel website called Travel.Lah. My goal for making this website because i want to introduce the best tourism destinations in Indonesia to all of the traveller over the world. So that they will be interested to have a tour in Indonesia with their friends or family.

This website contains several sections such as :

Header
Logo
Navbar
Jumbotron
Main Content
About Us
Website Adventages
Tour Packages
Reviews
Aside
Footer
I didn't not only make this website on desktop screen, but also on mobile screen without using any framework. For styling i was only using CSS Flexbox
